# The Goat and The Fence

I just read an interesting mathematical puzzle. Suppose there is a goat inside of a circular fence of a given radius. If the goat has a leash attached to a point inside the fence, how long does the leash have to be so that the goat can graze through exactly **half** the total area inside the fence?

It sounded like a reasonably easy problem to solve and I had nothing better to do, so I solved it.
